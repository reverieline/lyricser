# Sample song.txt file structure

Verse 1
This is where the first verse lyrics would go
Each line is on the same slide
Until there's a blank line

Chorus
This is the chorus section
Which appears on its own slide
After the blank line separator

Verse 2
The second verse appears here
On its own slide

Bridge
This is the bridge section
On its own slide

Chorus
The chorus repeats
On its own slide

# Note: The slides are separated by blank lines in the text file.
# This is just a sample structure showing how the lyrics should be formatted.
